#VUEJS DIVE AIR MIXER
---------------------

-IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER : Don't use this tool to plan your dive. Use it to get an idea, but please, do a calculation using another method. Please, double and triple check your calculations with your dive buddies. And, above all, check the air in your tank before the dive.

This app just shows the best air mix by just moving the sliders (input range). It uses vuejs as javascript frontend framework. It is nearly the third of line codes compare to the previous jquery version. Although, I hadn't optimized the JQuery version at all.

The code is provided as is with no warranty what so ever.

##Credits
